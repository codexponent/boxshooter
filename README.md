# Box Shooter

Box Shooter is a game made from Unity3d. It's about a lonely ball trying to collect all the coins while dodging or blasting through boxes. The box is confined within a certain boundary so if it leaves the boundary then the game would be over. This project is intended strictly for educational purposes, initially developed for the Coursera specialization game development program. It was initially shown on 2016.
